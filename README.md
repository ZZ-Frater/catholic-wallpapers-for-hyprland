# Catholic Wallpapers for Hyprland

## Description
I thought I'd share the wallpapers (x5) and screenlock background (x1) I use for my hyprland using hyprpaper.
These wallpapers are simply wallpapers and are suitable for any windows compositor, manager, or operating system.
I generated and edited these wallpapers using AI tools. I was aiming for an anime stylism common to the hyprland aesthetic, but here, in Catholic-style, hence “for hyprland.”
